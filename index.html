    <h1>Vivianne Gonzalez</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my blog!</p>
    <p>I am Vivianne, a computer science student at the University of New Mexico. Besides programming I enjoy reading philosophy, studying complexity, and practicing botany. This blog was created mostly to motivate me to continue developing my learning space. I may share code, recipes, poems, philosophical takeaways, the list goes on. There is really no objective here just a thinking ape on a flying rock experiencing the arrow of time.</p>
