        <p>  In recent years, the advent of generative AI has sparked much interest among educators, who recognize its potential to revolutionize the educational landscape. The emergence of this technology has created a unique opportunity to bridge the gap between academic knowledge and practical application, potentially enhancing students' learning experiences and overall performance. Researchers observed that the integration of AI and Computational Thinking (CT) in education can help students develop critical thinking skills, problem-solving, and technology skills that are essential in the 21st century (Huang & Qiao, 2022).
